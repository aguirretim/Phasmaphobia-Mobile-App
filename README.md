# Phasmaphobia Mobile App (Ghost Jounal)

This App is recreating the journal from the PC game Phasmaphobia as an android app. 

I first focused on creating a quick mock-up of the App.

I used these screens as a general base idea for the App.

The main feature of this App is to dynamically allow a player to more quickly identify ghost by narrowing down evidence for the possible ghost easier.

Some future feature goals are to implement a timer for the difficulty and a ghost phrases generator.

Phasmophobia Mobile App (Ghost Journal) is currently only available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TimApps.phasmophobiamobilejournal)
