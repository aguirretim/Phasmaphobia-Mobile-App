# Phasmaphobia Mobile App (Ghost Jounal)

This App is focused on recreating the journal from the PC game Phasmaphobia as an android app. 

I first focused on creating a quick mock up of the app.

I used these screen as a genreal base idea for the app.

The main feature of this app is to dynamically allow a player to more quickly identify ghost by narrowing down evidence for the possible ghost easier.

Some future feature goals are to implement a timer for difficulty and ghost phrases generator.
